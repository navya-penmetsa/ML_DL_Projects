# Text & Image to 3D Model Prototype

A Python-based prototype that generates simple 3D object meshes from either text prompts or images. This project explores basic 3D shape generation using programmatic geometry and image pre-processing.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project attempts to bridge text/image inputs with 3D model generation. While not powered by large generative models, it provides a simplified demonstration of how structured data and visual cues can drive shape creation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Trimesh
- Matplotlib

## 📂 Features

- Convert text prompts (like "cube", "sphere", "pyramid") into 3D meshes
- Generate 3D shapes from binary or edge-detected images
- Export and visualize the 3D objects using `trimesh` and `matplotlib`
